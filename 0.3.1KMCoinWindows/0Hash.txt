File/Hash
---------
All hashes are computed using sha256 encryption.
Each file endsWith(a) "//" + "64 character hash"
Remove only the 64 characters and execute in cmd
    certutil -hashfile <KMCjavaFile>.java SHA256
The hash should match what you have removed. Yes
that is a Java joke above. I am glad you noticed


zSign
-----
All calculated file hashes can be found in zSign
They are ordered alphanumerically by file name
The command to hash the file is also present
