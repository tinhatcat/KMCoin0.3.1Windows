Closed the scanner in KMCoin2. Should keep Windows OS focus.

Changed sync information to reflect current discord !sync command.

Updated 'Help' section on login panel.

Users may now...

  close the txPanel without closing the cmd running KMCoin,

  minimize cmd and play Minecraft on full screen while.
